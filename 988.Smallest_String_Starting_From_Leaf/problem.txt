988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf
Solved
Medium

You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters 'a' to 'z'.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.

For example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".
A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.
