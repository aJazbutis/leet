Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.

Intuition:

Imagine a sliding window traversing the array. We keep track of the product of elements within the window. If the product becomes greater than or equal to k, we need to shrink the window from the left side until the product becomes less than k. This process ensures that all subarrays considered have a product strictly less than k.

Approach:

Initialization: Set left and right pointers to 0, product to 1 (initial empty subarray), and count to 0 (to store final subarray count).
Sliding Window:
While right hasn't reached the end (right < n):
Expand the window: Multiply product by the current element nums[right].
Shrink the window (if necessary):
While product is greater than or equal to k:
Divide product by the leftmost element nums[left] and increment left. This shrinks the window and reduces the product.
Count subarrays:
Add 1 + (right - left) to count. This accounts for:
1: The single-element subarray ending at right.
(right - left): The number of contiguous subarrays within the current window (excluding elements already removed in the inner loop).
Increment right to move the window one step forward.
Return Result:
Return the final count representing the total number of subarrays with product less than k.
